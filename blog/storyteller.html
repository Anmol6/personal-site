        <h1>AI Systems for the Storyteller</h1>
        <div class="date">April 2025</div>

        <p>You get to your office desk, run your data through your analytics AI agent, smile at the pretty charts, and then take a moment to appreciate how far you've come from a thousand days ago when you did all of this on your own.</p>

        <p>Next, you get ready for stand-up where you'll present "your" analysis in the form of a nice logical story. But then something interesting happens. Unlike ChatGPT, a colleague questions a critical assumption you made—"I think this column means something else." You pause, realize your mistake and get to redoing the analysis, this time completely yourself.</p>

        <p>This blog will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Describe the delegation problem in AI systems</li>
            <li>Make concrete recommendations for building more robust systems</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>As models improve every few months, our instinct to hand them bigger chunks of work grows. A common pattern:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Skim the high-level business problem</li>
            <li>Translate it into a semi-vague prompt</li>
            <li>Receive the agent output and format it for the team</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This produces three gaps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Misunderstanding of the problem (key assumptions untested)</li>
            <li>Lack of insight into the agent's reasoning</li>
            <li>Low-signal communication with the rest of the team</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To summarize: <strong>Delegation → disengagement → poor storytelling → weaker outcomes.</strong></p>

        <p class="caption">The problem: user acts as a pass-through for business problems.</p>

        <h2>The Goal</h2>
        <p>Instead of acting as a pass-through, the user should be an active storyteller—questioning, revising, and weaving a coherent narrative that solves the business problem. We should aim for a tighter coupling between the user and the AI.</p>

        <p class="caption">The goal: tighter coupling between the user and AI.</p>

        <h2>Designing Effective Systems</h2>
        <p>Below are guiding principles and concrete suggestions for building human–AI systems that encourage scrutiny, collaboration, and clear storytelling:</p>

        <h3>1. Show, Don't Just Tell</h3>
        <p>Hidden reasoning kills understanding.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Surface key assumptions:</strong> Have the agent print the premises it inferred ("growth = MAU", "seasonality ignored")</li>
            <li><strong>Expose the full trace:</strong> List data sources, filters, and model hops so users know where numbers came from</li>
            <li><strong>Quantify uncertainty:</strong> Attach confidence scores and offer at least one alternative interpretation the agent briefly considered and rejected</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Bias Towards Feedback Loops</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clarify early:</strong> The agent should ask follow-ups when context is thin ("profit or revenue?")</li>
            <li><strong>Inline feedback loops:</strong> Let users mark-up sentences or figures; the agent re-runs only the affected sections</li>
            <li><strong>Prompt scaffolds:</strong> Replace the blank box with a short form: goal, data, constraints, output style—three fields that force clearer thinking</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. The User Holds the Pen</h3>
        <p>Ownership keeps analysts engaged and prevents blind acceptance of pretty charts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Editable outputs:</strong> Deliver docs & decks that open in the native editor, not a PDF tomb</li>
            <li><strong>Expose dials:</strong> Dates, segments, model temperature—make them sliders the user can tweak in seconds</li>
            <li><strong>Branch, don't overwrite:</strong> One-click "fork" spawns a sibling analysis so competing assumptions can coexist</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Preserve Context</h3>
        <p>Storytelling is about context, context, and context.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bridge silos:</strong> Pipe CRM notes, support tickets, and finance tables into the same workspace so the agent can cross-reference</li>
            <li><strong>Prime with domain knowledge:</strong> Load the company glossary, past retros, and known KPI definitions before each session to cut re-explaining</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Focus on the Narrative Arc</h3>
        <p>A list of facts is good but a story is what moves decisions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Outline first:</strong> The agent proposes a 3-line arc ("problem → evidence → action") before writing prose</li>
            <li><strong>Synthesize, don't stack:</strong> Encourage paragraphs that connect dots ("sales dipped after marketing paused campaigns") rather than bullet dumps</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Takeaway</h2>
        <p>AI accelerates workflows, but key decisions will still be moved by human voice in the near future. Stay in the loop, shape the arc, and make the numbers speak.</p>
