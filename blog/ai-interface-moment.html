        <h1>The AI Interface Moment</h1>
        <div class="date">February 2026</div>

        <p>Seeing so many tools ship first-class MCP integrations to Claude Code. It really feels like future interfaces are being defined right now. A few implications worth thinking through:</p>

        <h2>Claude as the Distribution Chokepoint</h2>

        <p>If MCP becomes the dominant protocol and Claude is the primary consumer of MCP servers, Claude effectively becomes the app store. That's a massive amount of leverage. Apps need Claude more than Claude needs any single app. Classic aggregator dynamic.</p>

        <p>Open question: does this end up looking like iOS (curated, controlled, high-margin) or the open web (fragmented, competitive)? MCP's open spec pulls one way, Claude's dominance as the consumption layer pulls the other.</p>

        <h2>App Differentiation Narrows</h2>

        <p>With Claude mediating the interaction, apps lose control of the surface area where they used to differentiate: the UI. When your product is accessed through a text interface controlled by someone else, you can't compete on design, discoverability, or user experience polish. What's left is the same thing that survives in mature app store ecosystems: strong vertical niches where domain expertise matters, proprietary data that can't be replicated, and brand trust built over years.</p>

        <p>Expect a wave of "MCP-native" startups that are basically thin wrappers around existing APIs, followed by consolidation around tools with genuine depth and data moats. The wrapper startups will be easy to build and easy to kill. The survivors will be the ones with something Claude can't just do itself.</p>

        <h2>Power Law of Utility</h2>

        <p>Almost certainly a power law where the top 10-15 MCP integrations (GitHub, Linear, Notion, Slack, etc.) deliver the vast majority of value. These are the tools that touch daily workflows for most knowledge workers. Everything beyond that tier is fighting for scraps of attention in a long tail of niche use cases.</p>

        <p>This raises a strategic question for Anthropic: where do you invest in first-party integrations vs. leaving room for the ecosystem? And how aggressively do you build your own versions of the most critical tools? The temptation to own the full stack is real, but so is the risk of alienating the developer ecosystem that's currently building on top of you.</p>

        <h2>True Personalization is the Next Unlock</h2>

        <p>And it's way harder than people think.</p>

        <p>"I know you're an engineer interested in design" is not personalization—it's a preference setting. The real thing looks like "here are 3 things you should focus on this week to unblock Project X, based on what I've seen across your Slack, docs, and commits." That's contextual, opinionated, actionable intelligence that turns an assistant into a genuine co-pilot. It requires the system to have a model of your priorities, your blockers, your communication patterns, and the state of your projects—not just your job title.</p>

        <p>The compounding effects are massive. The longer you use it, the more valuable it gets, the harder it is to leave. Retention goes brrr. But this is not a plug-and-play property of the model. It requires serious engineering (data pipelines, permission models, memory architectures, context prioritization) and, before any of that, data readiness on the user's side that most orgs simply don't have yet.</p>

        <p>If personalization is the moat, the competitive question shifts from "which model is smartest" to "which model knows me best." That reframes the AI race from a benchmark competition into a data flywheel competition, and it suggests Anthropic's consumer product strategy (claude.ai, memory, projects) isn't a side bet but the whole game.</p>

        <h2>Network Effects, But Not the Kind We're Used To</h2>

        <p>The traditional network effect is "more users make the product better for all users." The emerging one here is different: it's a network of agents that can communicate, coordinate, and transact across tools and contexts on behalf of their users. Your agent talks to my agent, they negotiate a meeting time, pull the relevant docs, and prep us both before we show up.</p>

        <p>Scale that up and you get something like mini economies. Agents procuring services from other agents, delegating subtasks, routing work based on capability and availability. The value of being on the network isn't just that more people are there—it's that more capable agents are there, and the density of useful work that can happen without human intervention keeps increasing. We're not quite there yet, but the infrastructure is being laid right now.</p>
