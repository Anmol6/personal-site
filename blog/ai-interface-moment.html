        <h1>The AI War for Enterprise</h1>
        <div class="date">February 2026</div>

        <p>Seeing so many tools ship first-class MCP integrations to AI coding agents. It really feels like future interfaces are being defined right now. A few implications worth thinking through:</p>

        <h2>AI Assistants as the Distribution Chokepoint</h2>

        <p>In the enterprise context, UX has never been the primary driver of procurement decisions :). What matters is utility per unit time. And with AI assistants' increasingly impressive capabilities and expanding MCP integrations (Claude leading the way here), most competing apps will offer few unique advantages to displace them. In industries with regulations, the transition will be gradual but I guess it to be a near certainty.</p>

        <p>If AI assistants become the dominant work OS in the near future, MCP becomes the dominant protocol and they effectively become the app store for work. That's a massive amount of leverage. Apps need AI assistants more than any assistant needs any single app. Classic aggregator dynamics.</p>

        <p>Open question: does this end up looking like iOS (curated, controlled, high-margin) or the open web (fragmented, competitive)? MCP's open spec pulls one way, platform dominance at the consumption layer pulls the other.</p>

        <h2>Power Law of Utility</h2>

        <p>There's almost certainly a power law where the top 5-10 MCP integrations (GitHub, Linear, Notion, Slack, etc.) deliver the vast majority of value for most enterprises. Everything beyond that tier is fighting for scraps of attention, and will come and go in waves.</p>

        <p>This raises a strategic question for AI labs: where do you invest in first-party integrations vs. leaving room for the ecosystem? And how aggressively do you build your own versions of the most critical tools?</p>

        <h2>True Personalization is Next</h2>

        <p>"I know you're an engineer interested in design" is not enough, we're moving towards "here are 3 things you should focus on this week to unblock Project X, based on what I've seen across your Slack, docs, and commits."</p>

        <p>The compounding effects of this in-context intelligence are massive. The longer you use it, the more valuable it gets, the harder it is to leave (retention goes brrr). But this is not a plug-and-play property of the model. It demands real infrastructure: data pipelines, permission models, memory architectures, context prioritization. And before any of that, data readiness on the user's side that most orgs simply don't have yet (shameless plug to reach out to ya boi <a href="https://you.com">@you.com</a> if you need help with this). Models themselves will stop being the differentiator for the vast majority of work in the next 12 months. What will matter is the data flywheel: who can build compounding context around their users fastest.</p>

        <h2>Network Effects, But Not the Kind We're Used To</h2>

        <p>The traditional network effect is "more users make the platform better for all users". The emerging one here is different in that it will be much stronger: it's a network of agents (>> # number of humans on any platform) that can communicate, coordinate, and transact across tools and contexts on behalf of their users. Your agent talks to my agent, they negotiate a meeting time, pull the relevant docs, and prep us both before we show up.</p>

        <p>At this scale, you get something like many concurrent economies. It will be hard to fathom the winner-takes-all dynamics of this.</p>
